# Album Player

This proyect was made by Victor Chi Medina as a code challenge.
It took me almost 24 hours to complete it with no sleep time.
It's made with Angular and used Angular Material and just a bit of CSS animations.

## Development server

In case anything is needed, run `npm install`, once you are in the project folder, please run `ng serve` for a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Last Words

I hope you guys like it and find it really cool.
I didn't made just an Album Galery of my favorite band. I made it a functional preview player using the data I got from the iTunes API.

If you want to find another band, on the `app.component.ts:142` you can change the band.
